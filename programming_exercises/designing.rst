Designing programming exercises
===============================

.. styled-topic::

  Main questions:
      How to design a programming exercise that teaches a particular
      subject? What I need to know besides the A+ related technicalities?

  Topics:
      Practical tips on how to design new programming exercises:
      pedagogical and software development aspects.
      Exercise instructions, code template, model solution, grading,
      testing

  What you are supposed to do?
      Read the documentation.

This chapter is meant for course assistants and lecturers who develop programming
exercises. It is generic knowledge on creating exercises besides on the A+ related
technicalities.

.. admonition:: Best practises, not an authoritative guide
  :class: warning

    The knowledge here is compilation of best practises that have been used on
    years 2017-2021 on courses *Data Structures and Algorithms Y* and *Computing
    Applications*. It is not solid pedagogical or software engineering
    knowledge. Of course, programming exercise design also dependes on
    pedagogical techniques, teacher preference, and the subject to be taught.
    Therefore, reel free to apply the instructions at your own consideration.
